***

**ln** : Create hard and symbolic links

***

**ln file link** : Create hard link

**ln -s file link** : Create symbolic link

Note :

1. A hard link cannot reference a file outside its own file system. i.e., hard links cannot span physical devices

2. A hard link may not reference a directory.

3. A symbolic link may reference a directory or a file.

4. If you write some something to the symbolic link, the referenced file is also written to

5. In symbolic links most file operations are carried out on the link's target, not the link itself. rm is an exception.

6. When you delete a symbolic link, only the link is deleted, not the file itself

7. If the file is deleted before the symbolic link, the link will continue to exist, but will point to nothing

***

## Working with Commands

***

**type** – Indicate how a command name is interpreted

***

Command can be one of the four different things. 

1. An executable program

2. A command built in to shell

3. A shell function

4. An alias


The type command is a shell builtin that displays the kind of command the shell will execute, given a particular command name.


$ **type cd**

cd is a shell builtin

$ **type alias**

alias is a shell builtin

$ **type ls**

ls is /bin/ls

***

**which** – Display which executable program will be executed

***

$ **which ls**

/bin/ls

which only works for executable programs, not shell builtins not aliases

***
### Getting A Command's Documentation
***

**help command_name** : Display the built-in help for the given command

**man command_name** – Display a command's manual page

**apropos search_term** – Display a list of appropriate commands whose man pages contain the **search_term**

**info** – Display a command's info entry

**whatis command_name** – Display a very brief description of a command

***

**alias alias_name='command_string'** – Create an alias **alias_name** for a command **command_string**

**unalias alias_name** – Remove an alias **alias_name**

**alias** : See all the alias defined in that environment

***

## I/O Re-direction

***

cat - Concatenate files

sort - Sort lines of text

uniq - Report or omit repeated lines

grep - Print lines matching a pattern

wc - Print newline, word, and byte counts for each file

head - Output the first part of a file

tail - Output the last part of a file

tee - Read from standard input and write to standard output and files

***

	file descriptor for standard input stream : 0>

	file descriptor for standard output stream : 1>

	file descriptor for standard error stream : 2>

**Redirecting Standard Output to a File :** ls -l /bin/usr > ls-output.txt *(overwrites if the file is already present)*

**Redirecting Standard Output to a File :** ls -l /bin/usr >> ls-output.txt *(appends if the file is already present)*

**Redirecting Standard Error to a File :** ls -l /bin/usr 2> ls-error.txt *(overwrites if the file is already present)*

**Redirecting Standard Error to a File :** ls -l /bin/usr 2>> ls-error.txt *(appends if the file is already present)*

**Redirecting both Standard Output And Standard Error To One File example 1 :** ls -l /bin/usr > ls-output.txt 2>&1

- First we redirect standard output to the file ls-output.txt

- then we redirect file descriptor two (standard error) to file descriptor one (standard output) using the notation 2>&1

**Redirecting both Standard Output And Standard Error To One File example 2 :** ls -l /bin/usr &> ls-output.txt

**Suppressing error messages :** ls -l /bin/usr 2> /dev/null

**Redirecting Standard Input from keyboard to File :** cat < lazy_dog.txt

***

## Command line interpretation at Shell

***

**Expansion** : With expansion, you type something and it is expanded into something else before the shell acts upon it

**Pathname Expansion** : The mechanism by which wildcards work is called pathname expansion

**Tilde Expansion** : When used at the beginning of a word, it expands into the home directory of current user

**Arithmetic Expansion** : The shell allows arithmetic to be performed by expansion. e.g., echo $((2 + 2))

**Brace Expansion** : you can create multiple text strings from a pattern containing braces

	$ echo Front-{A,B,C}-Back
	Front-A-Back Front-B-Back Front-C-Back
	
	$ echo Number_{1..5}
	Number_1 Number_2 Number_3 Number_4 Number_5
	
	$ echo {Z..A}
	Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A
	
**Parameter Expansion** : Shell will expand the variable in the Command line before the command execution.

	$ echo $USER
	zikzak

**Command Substitution** : Command substitution allows us to use the output of a command as an expansion:

	$ ls -l $(which cp)
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 71516 2007-12-05 08:58 /bin/cp

**Quoting** : The shell provides a mechanism called quoting to selectively suppress unwanted expansions

**Double Quotes** : all the special characters used by the shell lose their special meaning and are treated as ordinary characters. The exceptions are “$”, “\” (backslash), and “`” (backquote). This means that word-splitting, pathname expansion, tilde expansion, and brace expansion are suppressed, but parameter expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution are still carried out.

**Single Quotes**: If we need to suppress all expansions, we use single quotes.
